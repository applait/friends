# Friends of Applait

This is the codebase that powers "Friends of Applait", the list of superbly brilliant people that are part of Applait or have helped Applait at some time during their lifetime.

This is our way of hi5-ing!

## Adding a name

Add a name to the `friends.json` file. The structure looks like:

```javascript
{
  "name": "Ananda Sen",
  "email": "ananda.sen@example.com",
  "facebook": "anandasen", // Facebook ID
  "twitter": "anandasen", // Twitter ID
  "github": "anandasen", // Github ID
  "contributions": ["code", "graphics", "documentation"] // Array of areas of contribution
}
```

## Thanks!

Contributions appreciated!
